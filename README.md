# PROJECT 1 - A TURTLE DRAWING
Due: Monday 9/28/2015 at 11:59 pm
For this project, we will want to use the Turtle class to draw a large multifaceted geometrical shape onto a picture. These modifications are to add "something" to the image. 
Normally this would be to draw something in the foreground of an image that is just a scene. 
Examples of such drawing can be shown by these examples or these examples.
The objectives of this assignment are to have you define your own Java methods to add to the basic behavior of the Turtle Java class. You will write Java methods with and without parameters. 
You will then write a Java main program to call on those Java methods to draw connected multifaceted geometrical shapes that you have designed.

Requirements
Design the shapes you want drawn. You should have a minimum of 10 different shapes (that could be connected) to create a large multifaceted shape -- a building for example. 
Note that drawing two squares count as "two different shapes".
Write a Java program (e.g. one with a class method named main()) that does the following:
Creates a Picture for the turtles
Creates at least two Turtles in the Picture
Uses variables to keep track of pen colors, shape lengths. These "variables" could be method parameters.
Calls methods on each of the two Turtles to create a multifaceted geometrical shapes on the Picture. 
For example, you could draw multiple cabins in a beach picture along with sea stars or draw a blueprint of your dream home.
Moves the turtles to different locations in the Picture and changes their orientation in order to draw the shapes as desired.
Draws shapes by changing the default behavior of each Turtle object. For example, you can change the color and thickness of the pen used in drawing the shapes.
Define and write multiple methods to draw shapes using the turtles. At a minimum, you must include the following 5 methods:
A method to draw a rectangle of a specified width and height (e.g., the Turtle can be asked to draw rectangles of different dimensions by a call to the same method)
A method to draw a hexagon of a specified length and color (e.g., the Turtle can be asked to draw hexagon of different lengths and colors).
Three other methods to draw shapes of your own choosing. All methods must be flexible to allow the shape to be drawn in different sizes, or line thickness, or pen color.
